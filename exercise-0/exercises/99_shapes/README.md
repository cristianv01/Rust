# Intro

Final goal: Implement a Shape type that provides a method to detect when two shapes are overlapping.

The two shapes you will implement are a Circle and an axis-aligned Rectangle.
The coordinate system used for the shapes are as follows: The x-coordinate increases from *left to right*, while the y-coordinate increases from *top to bottom* in the grid.

Shape intersection formulas are given on the assignment page.
